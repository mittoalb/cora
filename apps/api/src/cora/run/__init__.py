"""Run bounded context.

Owns the actual-execution layer of CORA. Per the BC map's recipe
ladder, Run is the keystone — Method (≈ ISA-88 General Recipe) →
Practice (≈ Site Recipe) → Plan (≈ Master/Control Recipe) → **Run**
(actual batch execution; immutable, has FSM, audit trail, references
to Subject(s)).

A Run binds a `Plan` (which itself binds a Practice + Asset set)
and an optional `Subject` (sample being measured; null for dark-
field / flat-field calibration runs per beamline-domain convention,
where calibration data is consumed alongside sample data within the
same analysis pipeline).

Track A BC. Depends on:
  - `Recipe.Plan` (referenced by `Run.plan_id`; loaded at Run-start
    for re-validation of capability superset against current Asset
    state)
  - `Equipment.Asset` (transitive via Plan; loaded at Run-start to
    re-check that no bound Asset has been Decommissioned)
  - `Subject.Subject` (referenced by `Run.subject_id` if non-null;
    must be in Mounted or Measured state)

## Phase 6f-2 scope

Run + the two terminals reached from Running:
  - `id` + `name` (RunName: 11th bounded-name VO)
  - `plan_id: UUID` — eventual-consistency ref; existence verified
    at handler-load time
  - `subject_id: UUID | None` — null for calibration / dark-field
    runs; if non-null, Subject must be in Mounted | Measured
  - `status: RunStatus` (`Running | Completed | Aborted` at 6f-2;
    further transitions land in 6f-3+)

Cross-aggregate validation at Run-start (gate-review Q2 / Q5
locked answers): handler pre-loads Plan + Subject (if subject_id)
+ each bound Asset (from `plan.asset_ids`); decider receives
`RunStartContext` and validates as opaque domain inputs (same
canonical pattern as Plan's PlanBindingContext from 6e-1). Per
gate-review Q5: Run-start re-validates capability superset
against CURRENT Asset state (Plan-bind validated against then-
current; drift is real, Run is the last gate).

`complete_run` (Running → Completed) and `abort_run` (Running →
Aborted) are single-source today; tuple-membership guards leave
room for 6f-3+ to add `Held` if hold-then-X proves to be a real
beamline workflow. `RunCompleted` payload is slim by design
(`run_id` + `occurred_at`); substantive run summary lands in
6f-5+ once DAQ-substream integration is in place to source it.
`RunAborted` payload carries free-form `reason: str` (1-500
chars after trim); structured taxonomy is future-additive with
the three re-evaluation triggers documented at
`InvalidRunAbortReasonError`.

Phase history:
  - 6f-1: Run + start_run + get_run (the keystone slice) ✅
  - 6f-2: complete_run + abort_run (terminal happy + emergency
    exit) ✅
  - 6f-3 (deferred): Hold/Resume/Stop transitions
  - 6f-4 (deferred): Truncated terminal + truncation-reason design
  - 6f-5 (deferred): First substream infrastructure + per-frame
    trigger substream (high-cardinality telemetry)

Known gaps (pre-6f-1 sequencing decisions, gate-review Q3 locked):
  - **Supply availability check** (Track B Supply BC not shipped):
    Run-start does NOT verify beam / power / gas availability today.
    Operator-trusted; documented as gap. Lands when Supply BC ships.
  - **Decision approval check** (Decision BC not shipped):
    Run-start does NOT require an Approved Decision referencing
    the Plan today. Operator-trusted; documented as gap. Lands
    when Decision BC ships.
